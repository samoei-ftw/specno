# Specno Technical Assessment Submission
This is the central repository for the Specno Technical Assessment

## Running the project locally
There is a run.sh file in the root of this repository.
This script builds the Docker image from the Dockerfile, tags it as specno-backend, and runs it in a container accessible on port 8080.

To start the backend, simply run run.sh in your terminal:
$ ./run.sh

Once running, the backend will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.
